In the remaining section, we're going to go one by one through a series of tips that will help you avoid common pitfalls (or gotchas!) in pipelines. A quick list of what's to come:


- How to debug in a pipeline
- What is a cyclical dependency and how do I avoid it?
- Undocumented file output from function 
- Using a directory as a dependency 
- Can I _really_ only use filenames or object targets as arguments in pipeline functions? Understanding using of the `I()` helper
- The `target_name` special variable. Simplifying `target:command` relationships and reducing duplication
