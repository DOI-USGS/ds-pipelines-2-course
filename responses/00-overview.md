In our division we almost always work on code and data analyses in teams.
As a result, our projects need to support contributions of both code and data from multiple team members.
Git is great for sharing code, but it's not great at sharing data. The first part of this course is therefore
all about our current solution to data sharing within analysis pipelines.

In the second part of this course you'll learn about scaling: how to download many datasets,
run many models, or make many plots. Whereas a `for` loop would work for many quick tasks,
here our focus is on tools for managing sets of larger tasks that each take a long time and/or
are subject to occasional failure.

We'll also include some tips and tricks for pipelines that are _both_ collaborative and multi-task.
